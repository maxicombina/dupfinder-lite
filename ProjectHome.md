A Perl implementation of a duplicate file finder. It is inspired in fdupes (1), but the functionality is slightly different.

Patches/ideas/rants are welcomed :)

The project is kept small and simple. It depends on Perl 5.8.8, but a different version may work as well. No need to compile, just use it!
